                        To filter the results either enter the range for each parameter, enter the min field to create a greater-than parameter (leave
                        the max blank), or create a less-than parameter by entering the max (leave the min blank). CLicking "Apply" will instantly apply the
                        filter(s) to the table. However, clicking "Apply & Update URL" will add the parameters to the URL so you can bookmark the
                        link and save your chosen parameters.

                        Clicking on the Station ID will take you to the MesoWest tabular page for that station, From that page, the sidebar on the left can provide links to view graphical 
                        displays of any variable, change the date and time of displayed data, download data from any time range and any observation variables, and to view the station on a map.

                        Cells highlighted yellow indicate that a QC flag is associated with that observation. To view what the QC flag is for, hover over the cell for the flag description.
                        To preserve QC flags even as cells are highlighted for falling into a chosen range, the cell will highlight red with a yellow stripe.
