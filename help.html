                        an explanation on how to use all of the features of this application is listed below.

                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        Due to the dangerous and highly susceptible nature of wildland fires to change and threaten lives and property, it is critical
                        to monitor and be aware of conditions surrounding these wildfires. The vulnerability of fire-fighting
                        personnel and the public to changing weather conditions near wildfires necessitates improved monitoring
                        of those meteorological conditions around the nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of the National Mesonet Program of the National Weather Service, <a href
                            "https://synopticlabs.org">SynopticLabs/MesoWest</a> provides access to weather observations from over 30,000 locations that
                        are made available by hundreds of data providers. Federal and state agencies most responsible for
                        fighting wildfires support the Remote Automated Weather Station (RAWS) network to monitor conditions
                        in fire prone areas nationwide, while the National Weather Service often deploys portable RAWS stations
                        as part of fire suppression operations. Improving access to RAWS and other observations in intuitive
                        web displays is critical for improved situational awareness.

                    <h4>How It Works</h4>
                    <p>
                        Using Python, this web application first gets information regarding all Wildfires within the United States from the
                        <a href "http://rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/outgoing/GeoMAC/">GeoMAC</a> database. The file is parsed to gather
                        all relevant data and save it as a JSON dictionary. Before the file is made available for the webpage,
                        a query is made using the <a href "https://synopticlabs.org/api/mesonet/">MesoWest/Synoptic Labs API</a>
                        to find all weather stations within a large radius from the fire's center.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rest of the process uses JavaScript to load the JSON dictionary, query the MesoWest/Synoptic Labs API again for all recent
                        weather observations surrounding the fire, and then format and load that data into a simple, easy-to-read
                        table. The table uses <a href "https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>, a JavaScript
                        library, to quickly select and highlight data according to user-selected observation parameters,
                        to make it easy to see only those values that are of importance.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Using the Webpage</h4>
                    <p>
                        To filter the results either enter the range for each parameter, enter the min field to create a greater-than parameter (leave
                        the max blank), or create a less-than parameter by entering the max (leave the min blank). CLicking
                        "Apply" will instantly apply the filter(s) to the table. However, clicking "Apply & Update URL" will
                        add the parameters to the URL so you can bookmark the link and save your chosen parameters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clicking on the Station ID will take you to the MesoWest tabular page for that station, From that page, the sidebar on the
                        left can provide links to view graphical displays of any variable, change the date and time of displayed
                        data, download data from any time range and any observation variables, and to view the station on
                        a map.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cells highlighted yellow indicate that a QC flag is associated with that observation. To view what the QC flag is for, hover
                        over the cell for the flag description. To preserve QC flags even as cells are highlighted for falling
                        into a chosen range, the cell will highlight red with a yellow stripe.
                    </p>
