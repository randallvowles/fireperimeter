        <b><font COLOR="#17202A" SIZE=+2>About</font></b>
        <br><br> I am currently enrolled at the University of Utah, majoring in Atmospheric Science. I am a senior and will 
        graduate in December 2017 with my Bachelor of Science Degree. My education has been focused on forecasting, programming, and instrumentation.
        My senior project, under the direction and advising of <a href="http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0035056/home/" target="blank">Dr. John Horel</a>, involves creating 
        web-based displays that draw upon fire metadata from GeoMAC and weather metadata from the SynopticLabs Mesonet API (synopticlabs.org/api) to 
        help alert fire personnel and the public to weather conditions that are defined by them to be critical to monitor, e.g., user-selectable changes in winds, temperature, moisture, or weather conditions.

        <br><br> I am employed as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for <a href="http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/mesowest_overview/#" 
        target="blank">MesoWest Group</a>.
        I provide user support for <a href="http://mesowest.utah.edu" target="blank">MesoWest</a> and
        <a href="http://synopticlabs.org/" target="blank">SynopticLabs</a> services, primarily helping resolve issues with the webpage and API services. 
        I also write articles and guides for the <a href="http://blog.synopticlabs.org/" target="blank">SynopticLabs Blog</a> and maintain MesoWest's social media presence 
        on the <a href="https://twitter.com/mesowestutah" target="blank">MesoWest Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mesowest/" target="blank">
        MesoWest Facebook</a>.
        Additionally, I also serve as an assistant technician for our local network of stations across the Salt Lake Valley and over the Great Salt Lake, 
        performing maintenance visits and preparing instruments for deployment in the field.
